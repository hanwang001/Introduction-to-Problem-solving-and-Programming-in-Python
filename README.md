# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

I think I'll use game-like python as the theme

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A site that lets you play trivia games

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The envisioned project is an interactive and user-friendly website designed to provide an engaging trivia game experience. The software will allow users to play trivia games on a variety of topics, test their knowledge, and provide an enjoyable way to learn new facts.



## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I think it could be merged with a basic computer class.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

do it alone

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome of the final project will be a fully functional and user-friendly trivia game website featuring a variety of categories, engaging game modes, accurate trivia questions, an interactive user interface, and the ability for users to track their progress, thus providing an enjoyable and educational gaming experience for players of all ages.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The optimal outcome of the final project included not only core functionality, but also the implementation of real-time multiplayer capabilities, user-generated content, a sophisticated hint and lifeline system, seamless cross-device compatibility, a visually appealing and intuitive design, and a robust back-end infrastructure to create an immersive, social, and highly interactive trivia game platform.



### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The optimal outcome of the final project will include all of the above features, further enhanced by an intuitive AI-driven question generation system that ensures the availability of a virtually unlimited number of challenging and varied trivia questions, an immersive gameplay element with personalized avatars and achievements, and an active community of users contributing to an ever-expanding and enriched database of trivia questions, thus creating a dynamic, educational, and highly engaging trivia game experience.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

In the next step of the project, I will focus on building the core functionality of the trivia site, including the user interface, category selection, and question rendering. To accomplish this, I will utilize my existing knowledge of web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend scripting languages. Additionally, I will delve into randomized question generation algorithms to ensure a varied and challenging gaming experience. I will explore methods for integrating real-time multiplayer features, user-generated content systems, and gamification elements such as avatars and achievements.
